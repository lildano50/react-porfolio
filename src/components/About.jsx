        Welcome to my working portfolio. I'm currently a full stack web development stutent at the University of Texas - Austin Coding Bootcamp.
        Below you'll find my past projects. I've taken introductory classes in Python, C++, and Swift as part of the App Development and Design program at Austin Community College.

        I hope to continue learning these languages at Austin Community College as I grow my career. In my free time I enjoy photography, hiking, and exploring the outdoors, and I hope to tie these hobbies into my developer knowledge
        to create real world applications.
